Overview
===================================================================================
The code has been tested in  Visual Studio 2019 on Win10 (64 bits).

Thanks a lot!




Usage
==================================================================================
After you download dac_hmm,uncompress it, and compile acc_dac1.sln in Visual Studio.
Parameter input:
1.Hidden Markov model parameters: "testX.hmm"
2.H(X|Y)






File discription
===================================================================================
We can see bill.cpp,coder.cpp are main files.
The data folder stores the initial spectrum values of different R.
Hidden Markov model parameters(TABLE I.model for simulation) are saved in test1.hmm file.
